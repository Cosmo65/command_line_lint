* Description
  This script generates a report against your command-line history and suggests
  workflow improvements.  Its opinion is that most commands should be simple and
  require minimal typing.  The report contains:

  - comprehensive lists of commands you use, with and without arguments
  - suggestions for ways to shorten commands (aliases, alternative syntax)
  - a subset of lints from [[https://www.shellcheck.net][Shellcheck]], if installed; many of these can warn
    against dangerous habits

  The script does not use the network, and it doesn't move or store your command
  history anywhere.  It should be fairly portable, running on Python 2.7 or 3.4+
  and requiring "only" the standard library.

  This is an early prototype and has weak support for shells besides bash.
* Run
  Download [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/riscy/command_line_lint/master/command_line_lint.py][command_line_lint.py]] and run it:
  #+begin_src
  python command_line_lint.py <history_file>  # python 2 or 3 is fine
  #+end_src
  The =<history_file>= argument is optional.  If omitted, a determination is
  made based on the value of the =SHELL= environment variable:
  - =bash= uses =.bash_history=
  - =csh= and =tcsh= use =.history=
  - =zsh= uses the value of =HISTFILE=
  Not all shells have support for saving a history file (fish, dash, etc.)
* Configure
  =command_line_lint= gives better results under the following conditions
  (it will tell you about these, too):
  - The =HISTSIZE= environment variable should be large enough to produce useful
    usage summaries.  The defaults tend to be too small -- try 5000.
  - Retaining duplicate entries is important for being able to determine what
    you do the most, so variables/options like =bash='s =HISTCONTROL= or =zsh='s
    =histignorealldups= should be set appropriately.
  - If you use =bash=, ~shopt histappend~ should be set so that multiple
    concurrent shell sessions can all add to your =.bash_history=.  If you use
    =zsh=, ~setopt appendhistory~ should be set likewise.

  This script supports use of [[http://no-color.org][NO_COLOR]] to disable color output:
  #+begin_src bash
  NO_COLOR=1 python command_line_lint.py
  #+end_src

* Future
  Because those who do not learn from history are doomed to =!!=,
  additional reporting around some of the following would be useful:
  - Command fingerprinting to sort out common typos (~shopt dirspell~, if it
    exists, can be used to fix typos in =cd=)
  - Security checks in addition to readability of history file (for example
    warnings about plaintext passwords, etc.)
  - Analyzing sequences of commands for improvements (e.g., sometimes
    dry-running a command like ~rm -rf ./*~ with ~ls ./*~ is a good idea;
    switching back and forth between directories can use ~cd -~; switching
    back and forth between git branches can use ~git checkout -~; etc.)
  - Avoid piping =wget= into =sh=
